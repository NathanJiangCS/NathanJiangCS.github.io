I’ve spent the past four months in Mexico working as a software engineer for [Wizeline](https://www.wizeline.com/) and as August comes to an end, so does my first professional internship. Throughout this duration, I’ve faced the countless struggles associated with working in a foreign country -- dissimilar social constructs, cultural and linguistic barriers, and even simple things such as varying climates. Nevertheless, my time in Mexico has been one of the most memorable periods of my life. The people I met, the sights I saw, and the culture I experienced left a mark on me that undoubtedly shapes who I am today.

### How It All Started
At the beginning, I was very skeptical. I found the job posting for Wizeline on WaterlooWorks and from the research I did, Wizeline was a dream company to work for –- great job benefits, an amazing startup environment without the uncertainty, and utilization of modern, high-demand technologies. But despite all that, I was on the edge about applying. I was completely foreign to the working conditions in Mexico and my preconceptions were all heavily influenced by media; therefore, I couldn’t help thinking that my safety would frequently be compromised. Even after I was hired, I was told multiple times by friends and family that I should be careful and watch out for cartels. The only reason I applied in the end was because a close friend reminded me that I wasn’t going to get another chance like this and I should *carry through life seeking adventures and not things; have stories to tell and not stuff to show*. To this day, these words resonate with me and as I continue to look for new opportunities, I am inspired to visit new places and meet new people.

### Viva la Mexico
As soon as I arrived in Mexico, I realized that all the concerns were for nothing. I never once felt in danger and on top of that Mexicans have a remarkable culture around being open to everyone and being ready to celebrate anything. Seriously, as a Canadian (whom everyone thinks of as the nicest people in the world), I was astounded by how quickly I was integrated into social groups and making new friends. What was even crazier about Mexicans was how hard they party. Living in Guadalajara near Chapultepec, the nightlife was stunning and there were countless times where it seemed like the entire city was out, having a good time at 4am. Never have I heard so much mariachi, salsa, and reggaeton in my life. I would end up spending almost every weekend traveling anywhere I could, from the waterfalls of La Huesteca to the beaches of Puerto Vallarta. At one point, my friend, who was raised in Mexico, commented that I had been to more places in Mexico than he had. As I return to Canada, I hope to bring back a part of the crazy culture with me and show others what Mexico is like, past the veil of stereotypes.

### Wizeline
Working at Wizeline felt more like a hobby than a job. I was a software engineering intern that worked on the [Roadmap](https://www.wizelineroadmap.com/) team as, first, a backend developer, and then an software architect engineer. I had the opportunity to write and deploy backend code, devise software specifications for upcoming features, and even manage deployments for local, development, and production server instances. In a company of just over two hundred people, I felt incredibly close to my team as we always would chat together and go out after work. As my time came to a close at Wizeline, I was evidently heavy-hearted. It was sad to imagine that I wouldn’t be with my team, strangers who’ve quickly become some of my closest friends, for months if not years. I made the personal resolution to visit Guadalajara again when I get the chance and catch up with everyone.

### What’s Next
Now as I continue into my 2A term, I’m excited for what the future holds. My experience in Mexico has given me a newfound perspective on my world, one that is less obsessed with the materialistics and more focused on experiences. With this, my passion as a student, a passion that seemed to fade at the end of my 1B term due to a lack of direction, has been rekindled. I’m eager to connect with friends, new and old, see how everyone has changed, and show off how much I’ve grown.
